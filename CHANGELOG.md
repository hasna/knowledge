## 0.2.87

Reconcile `main` with the published npm line (`npm/knowledge/v0.2.86`), which had
diverged: the deployed runtime carried a Store-unification + cloud-routing refactor
that never landed on `main`, while `main` carried two CLI fixes the published line
lacked. This release re-converges both histories.

- Merge the published release tag `npm/knowledge/v0.2.86` into `main` (merge commit,
  preserving full ancestry so future `merge-base --is-ancestor` checks pass). Brings in:
  - refactor(store): unify knowledge-item CRUD behind one Store (LocalStore + ApiStore) (1506111)
  - refactor(knowledge): remove dead raw-fetch RemoteKnowledgeClient, make registry descriptor truthful (2b6bd21)
  - fix(knowledge): close residual cloud-mode routing gaps for catalog commands (2d235a9)
  - fix(knowledge): route SDK item CRUD + inventory through the unified Store in all 3 modes (92c3fcc)
  - fix(knowledge): close split-brain read + drop dead API client and client DSN surface (5213a51)
  - fix(knowledge): stop context-pack hang, repair cloud project-panel, drop dead remote command (8daa0ea)
- Retains the two `main`-only CLI fixes on top of the refactor:
  - fix(cli): don't leak internal Error stack on usage/validation errors (#23)
  - fix(cli): make `<sub> --help` print per-command usage (#24)
- Version bumped to 0.2.87 (strictly above published 0.2.86) so npm and `main` reconverge on publish.
