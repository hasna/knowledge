/**
 * @hasna/knowledge — outbound request guard.
 * Copyright 2026 Hasna Inc.
 * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
 *
 * THE control that keeps a test run off the live store: while `NODE_ENV=test`,
 * an outbound HTTP request made through this package's own `fetch` call sites
 * whose target is not loopback is refused before a socket is opened.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated precisely because a guard people believe covers more than it
 * does is worse than a narrow one. Covered: the cloud item transport
 * (cloud-store.ts, via the contracts client's `fetchImpl`) and web source-ref
 * ingestion (source-ingest.ts). NOT covered: third-party SDK transports that
 * carry their own HTTP stacks — `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and the `ai` provider
 * clients. Those are credential-gated and the suite drives them with `--fake`,
 * so they are not the live-write path this defends; guarding them would mean
 * injecting a fetch into each SDK and is deliberately left out of this change.
 *
 * It guards the EGRESS, not the environment, and that distinction is the whole
 * design. Clearing the selector variables at startup — a preload, a
 * `beforeAll`, a wrapper script — cannot work: a test file that assigns those
 * variables at module scope runs AFTER any one-shot clear, `bun test` executes
 * many files in one process with one preload, so a single file's leak reaches
 * every later file, and a `bunfig.toml` preload resolves from the cwd and is
 * simply absent when the suite is invoked from a subdirectory. Each of those
 * produced a GREEN run with writes going out over HTTP. A check at the point of
 * egress has none of those escape routes, because by then it does not matter
 * which layer decided to make the request or when the variable was set.
 *
 * Loopback is allowed on purpose. Tests that stand up a `Bun.serve` on
 * 127.0.0.1 and exercise the real HTTP transport against it are the good case —
 * they are hermetic. Refusing them would push the suite toward stubbing the
 * transport, which is precisely how an egress bug hides. That allowance is not a
 * springboard: while armed, {@link guardedFetch} follows redirects itself and
 * checks EVERY hop, because a 302 followed internally by `fetch` never comes
 * back through a `fetchImpl` and so would leave the machine through a request
 * the guard had already approved.
 *
 * There is NO opt-out. Every in-repo script that legitimately talks to a real
 * endpoint (`scripts/smoke-*.mjs`) runs outside `bun test` and so is never
 * under the guard; an escape hatch would only exist to be used by the next test
 * that "just needs one real call".
 *
 * Messages never include the target host. The repo already refuses cloud
 * configuration "without leaking the URL", and a refusal message is exactly the
 * text that ends up pasted into a task comment or a CI log.

 * `fetch` with the guard in front of it. Installed permanently at the transport

 * request by the environment and never by whatever it happened to be at the
 * moment the client was constructed.
 *
 * REDIRECTS ARE FOLLOWED HERE, NOT BY `fetch`, while the guard is armed. Checking
 * only the first target is not enough: `fetch` follows a 3xx internally and an
 * internal hop never comes back through a `fetchImpl`, so a hermetic 127.0.0.1
 * server answering 302 with an off-box `Location` reached the network through a
 * request the guard had already approved — measured at 4 connect() calls to :443
 * and a real HTTP 200 from a public host. Every hop is now checked, and an
 * off-box hop is refused with the same host-withholding error as a first-hop
 * refusal, so the loopback allowance cannot be used as a springboard.
 *
 * Unarmed, this is plain `fetch` with plain `fetch` redirect handling: the
 * production path is untouched. A caller that sets `redirect` explicitly keeps
 * its own semantics — the manual walk only replaces the default `follow`.
 * Re-issuing a hop reuses `init.method`/`init.body`; a `Request` input's body is
 * not replayed, which is sound for this package because both real call sites
 * (the contracts transport and web source ingestion) pass a URL string plus an
