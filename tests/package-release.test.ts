   * Imports of a published script that would NOT resolve for someone who installed the

   * that pin it call THIS function - if it stops reporting, both fail.
   *
   * That structure is the point. Three previous versions of this check could each be replaced
   * with something that reports nothing while the whole suite stayed green, because the tests
   * that were supposed to pin them exercised a private copy of the logic instead of the logic
   * itself. Silent-green was the defect; moving the implementation never fixed it.
   *
   * Scope limit, stated rather than implied by the name: the transpiler reports `import`,
   * `import()` and `export … from`. It does NOT report `require()`, `import.meta.resolve()`,
   * or `new URL('./x', import.meta.url)`. No published script uses those today, and the last
   * is the plausible one to appear, since it is how you reference a sibling that must be in
   * `files`. A file the transpiler cannot parse throws, so that path is loud, not silent.
   *
   * Imports are extracted with the real transpiler, NOT by stripping comments and matching a
   * regex. Two hand-written strippers were tried and both had the same defect: a `/*` inside
   * an ordinary string opened a phantom comment and silently deleted real imports. The second
   * only moved the trigger - a regex literal containing a quote (`/['"]/`) shifted it into
   * string state and everything after it vanished. Extracting imports is a parsing problem;
   * anything short of a parser is a guess that fails silently.
